My name is Thomas Dubuc; I've been interested in game design for years, starting with CSGO maps and Blender modelling and now using complete production workflows to model and design proper assets. I love participating in game jams, especially when modelling in different styles, challenging my creativity by producing a finished product.

##Recent Works

This model was made for the game Malicious Monsters, which is a game I and 6 others are developing. This was a fun model designed off an UZI although I removed certain features to keep with the theme and topology style. It was made in blender and textured in Substance Painter, which I've been developing a better understanding of this workflow, especially when dealing with n-gons.
