My name is Thomas Dubuc; I've been interested in game design for years, starting with CSGO maps and Blender modelling and now using complete production workflows to model and design proper assets. I love participating in game jams, especially when modelling in different styles, challenging my creativity by producing a finished product.

## Recent Works

This model was made for the game Malicious Monsters, which is a game I and 6 others are developing. This was a fun model designed off an UZI although I removed certain features to keep with the theme and topology style. It was made in blender and textured in Substance Painter, which I've been developing a better understanding of this workflow, especially when dealing with n-gons.

The water gun was made as a secret weapon/testing weapon for the game Malicious Monsters. I found inspiration from earlier water gun models where the simplicity and colours really made the style work. It was lots of fun, and I feel adding more details in a fake way makes the weapon look cool, but it is obvious that they are decorations. The highlight was texturing this model, which was fun; one of its main points is the sun-tanned and dirty look to create the effect of laying outside all day and getting scratched and dirty from playing.
